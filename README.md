🛠️ Getting Started

Clone the repository and bootstrap the local environment:

npm install
npm run dev

Development server:
http://localhost:3000

Hot-reload is enabled out-of-the-box for rapid iteration.

📦 Build & Deployment

Produce a production-grade build:

npm run build
npm start

The output conforms to Next.js’ optimized deployment model, suitable for Vercel, Dockerized infrastructure, and other Node-compatible hosting layers.
